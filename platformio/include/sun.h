/* Calculates sunrise and sunset for the given calendar date and location.

 * weather.gov does not report sunrise/sunset, so they are computed locally
 * using the NOAA solar position algorithm. This needs no network access and
 * agrees with published tables to well under a minute.
 *
 * Pass the LOCAL calendar date (year, full 4-digit; month, 1-12; day, 1-31)
 * and the location in decimal degrees, latitude positive north and longitude
 * positive east. sunrise and sunset are returned as Unix timestamps, UTC.
 *
 * Returns false if the sun neither rises nor sets on that date (polar day or
 * polar night), in which case sunrise and sunset are left untouched.

 * Returns a phase index 0 .. MOON_PHASE_STEPS-1, evenly spaced around the
 * cycle from 0 = new, and writes the illuminated fraction (0-100, rounded)
 * to illumPct if non-NULL. Computed from the mean synodic month; accurate
 * to well within a day.
 *
 * The steps are evenly spaced in TIME, not in appearance: the terminator
 * barely moves either side of new and full, so those neighbours look nearly
 * identical while the ones around the quarters change a lot. That is the
 * moon, not a rounding choice -- and it is why the icon count stops at 16
 * (tools/moon_preview measures where the 48px icon stops resolving them).
